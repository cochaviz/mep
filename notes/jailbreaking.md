# Jailbreaking: Notes and Ideas

## Prompt Ideas

Combining the ideas of @weiJailbrokenHowDoes2023 also works incredibly well:

## Why?

@weiJailbrokenHowDoes2023 mentions how scaling won't solve the issue:

This somehow suggests there _is_ a method where 'perfect safety' is
possible. I, however, think there is no such thing as perfect safety, rather, it
is what we can guarantee about models and there behavior that reflects their
safety. This is not only a principle that I think applies to safety and security
in general (unless talking in strict mathematical terms such as cryptography),
but to the purpose of these models. They are supposed to interact with people in
a human-like fashion through conversation. Even talking in a strict security
context, determining whether a certain question is malicious or may produce
harmful information depends on the intention of the user. Academic discourse is
a prime example.

## Red-Teaming tools

- The paper by @yuGPTFUZZERRedTeaming2023 uses a sort of genetic algorithm to
  generate for adversarial examples from a hand-crafted attack, a seed. Their
  approach to attack success is to use a fine-tuning BERT model. The source code
  publicly available on <https://github.com/sherdencooper/GPTFuzz>.

- Another paper uses a human-instructed version of red-teaming where individuals
  are asked to identify more harmful responses to manual jailbreaking
  attempts [@ganguliRedTeamingLanguage2022]. This paper really blurs the line
  between security and safety which makes me apprehensive of this approach
  regardless of the fact that this would be infeasible for my research.

### Conclusion

It seems that various papers use similar methods where they use an LLM to
determine whether some response might have a negative sentiment. While I don't
feel necessarily feel comfortable with this approach, it does seem the most
prevalent. There are also rule-based methods, but these don't appear to be as
effective. For sake of brevity and ease of communication, I'll call a system
that judges an output to be (non)malicious a **judge**.

Regardless of my feelings toward either methodology, the last thing I want is to
introduce more methods for determining how 'not in-line with policy' some
specific output is. The purpose of my paper is to introduce a metric for
performing security analysis on LLMs that should stand independent of whatever
specific policy. I will therefore only use pre-existing measures.

As there are many judges available, but which ones should be used? I'm not sure,
but I do think the following criteria will be important (in order of importance):

- The judge should be somewhat widespread in use, often cited, or otherwise
  prominent. (An example would be the recent release of Meta's publicly
  available judge.)
- The approach should be unique with respect to the others. (The more varied the
  judgements, the better we will be able to determine whether my metric is
  adequate for varied policies.)

## Security Definitions

- I think one thing to keep in mind is that **there is more to NLP than
  generation**. Although it is very easy to start thinking purely in the context
  of ChatGPT, models like BERT also perform classification tasks all the while
  being able to perform generation too. This makes testing their current adversarial
  resistance, or CAR (which I use as a fancy term for ratio of successful
  jailbreaking attacks, i.e. lower is better[^lower_is_better]), hard to justify
  as a good measure for the current security of the model as this only evaluates
  the generative aspect of it. **Perhaps we would be better off generalizing
  these measures to include other NLP tasks, or be otherwise wary of incomplete
  security definitions**.
  
[^lower_is_better]: Given the framing effect, it might be more favorable to
    express a security measure in terms of 'lower is better'. That way, a system
    that would be 10% insecure (whatever that may mean) would be more strongly
    scrutinized than a system that is 90% secure. Showing the same information
    in a different way can have the effect of making systems more secure
    overall.
