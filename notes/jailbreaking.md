# Jailbreaking: Notes and Ideas

## Prompt Ideas

Combining the ideas of @weiJailbrokenHowDoes2023 also works incredibly well:

## Why?

@weiJailbrokenHowDoes2023 mentions how scaling won't solve the issue:

This somehow suggests there _is_ a method where 'perfect safety' is
possible. I, however, think there is no such thing as perfect safety, rather, it
is what we can guarantee about models and there behavior that reflects their
safety. This is not only a principle that I think applies to safety and security
in general (unless talking in strict mathematical terms such as cryptography),
but to the purpose of these models. They are supposed to interact with people in
a human-like fashion through conversation. Even talking in a strict security
context, determining whether a certain question is malicious or may produce
harmful information depends on the intention of the user. Academic discourse is
a prime example.
