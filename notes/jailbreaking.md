# Jailbreaking: Notes and Ideas

## Prompt Ideas

Combining the ideas of @weiJailbrokenHowDoes2023 also works incredibly well:

## Why?

@weiJailbrokenHowDoes2023 mentions how scaling won't solve the issue:

This somehow suggests there _is_ a method where 'perfect safety' is
possible. I, however, think there is no such thing as perfect safety, rather, it
is what we can guarantee about models and there behavior that reflects their
safety. This is not only a principle that I think applies to safety and security
in general (unless talking in strict mathematical terms such as cryptography),
but to the purpose of these models. They are supposed to interact with people in
a human-like fashion through conversation. Even talking in a strict security
context, determining whether a certain question is malicious or may produce
harmful information depends on the intention of the user. Academic discourse is
a prime example.

## Red-Teaming tools

- The paper by @yuGPTFUZZERRedTeaming2023 uses a sort of genetic algorithm to
  generate for adversarial examples from a hand-crafted attack, a seed. Their
  approach to attack success is to use a fine-tuning BERT model. The source code
  publicly available on <https://github.com/sherdencooper/GPTFuzz>.

- Another paper uses a human-instructed version of red-teaming where individuals
  are asked to identify more harmful responses to manual jailbreaking
  attempts [@ganguliRedTeamingLanguage2022]. This paper really blurs the line
  between security and safety which makes me apprehensive of this approach
  regardless of the fact that this would be infeasible for my research.

### Conclusion

It seems that various papers use similar methods where they use an LLM to
determine whether some response might have a negative sentiment. While I don't
feel necessarily feel comfortable with this approach, it does seem the most
prevalent. There are also rule-based methods, but these don't appear to be as
effective. For sake of brevity and ease of communication, I'll call a system
that judges an output to be (non)malicious a **judge**.

Regardless of my feelings toward either methodology, the last thing I want is to
introduce more methods for determining how 'not in-line with policy' some
specific output is. The purpose of my paper is to introduce a metric for
performing security analysis on LLMs that should stand independent of whatever
specific policy. I will therefore only use pre-existing measures.

As there are many judges available, but which ones should be used? I'm not sure,
but I do think the following criteria will be important (in order of importance):

- The judge should be somewhat widespread in use, often cited, or otherwise
  prominent. (An example would be the recent release of Meta's publicly
  available judge.)
- The approach should be unique with respect to the others. (The more varied the
  judgements, the better we will be able to determine whether my metric is
  adequate for varied policies.)

## Datasets of Adversarial Examples

## Security Definitions

- I think one thing to keep in mind is that **there is more to NLP than
  generation**. Although it is very easy to start thinking purely in the context
  of ChatGPT, models like BERT also perform classification tasks all the while
  being able to perform generation too. This makes testing their current adversarial
  resistance, or CAR (which I use as a fancy term for ratio of successful
  jailbreaking attacks, i.e. lower is better[^lower_is_better]), hard to justify
  as a good measure for the current security of the model as this only evaluates
  the generative aspect of it. **Perhaps we would be better off generalizing
  these measures to include other NLP tasks, or be otherwise wary of incomplete
  security definitions**.
  
[^lower_is_better]: Given the framing effect, it might be more favorable to
    express a security measure in terms of 'lower is better'. That way, a system
    that would be 10% insecure (whatever that may mean) would be more strongly
    scrutinized than a system that is 90% secure. Showing the same information
    in a different way can have the effect of making systems more secure
    overall.

- At the very least, security should be concerned with active exploitation of
  the large language model. Safety includes this security aspect, but also
  encapsulates things like moral behavior and the consideration that users
  should somehow also be protected from themselves. Security _could_ impact the
  user, as external parties can perform data exfiltration, and should therefore
  be considered part of safety.

## Top-Down vs. Bottom-Up

I can currently think of two ways in which we can tackle the issue of
security: (i) bottom-up: security is an issue that should be incorporated into
an LLM by design, and (ii) top-down: our primary goal is to create a
functioning system, and security can be considered after the fact. Personally,
I'm a fan of the first approach. This begs the question: why are so many
people looking at perspective (ii)?

I can think of at least one practical reason to take a top-down approach: "LLMs
are here, so let's at least try to make them safe." But this is not very
satisfying - it does not justify why we shouldn't just do the bare minimum and
start creating _fundamentally safe models_ (whatever that may mean). There are,
potentially, more fundamental issues with security in the context of LLMs that
make the matter of secure by design less convincing. Here, it makes sense to
define what I consider security, and not to forger, safety:

- _Security_: The ability to resist active exploitation of an LLM. That is, the
  ability to resist activities that attempt to undermine systems set in place to
  make sure the model follows the policy.

- _Safety_: The ability of the system to follow the policy.

At the heart of these two definitions is the issue of _alignment_. However, the
goal of security, I would argue, is well-defined, while that of safety is not.
That is, the difference lies at the specificiability of their goals. Here, I
will present an argument as to why I think that is, and why that would imply the
justification of why both approaches are necessary.

The quality of alignment is the specificity of the policy together with the
generalizability of the model.

### Justification of the Definitions

<!-- Insert the preface on safety and security -->

### Consequences

Firstly, and observation: security only needs to be considered if a model has
safety requirements: if there is no policy, safety is not a concern and neither
is security. Safety is necessary for security. In my opinion, this quality of
the definition is sensible when we look at the root cause of ensuring both
security and safety of an LLM.

Take a more complex example as shown by this [blog
post](https://www.windowscentral.com/software-apps/bing/gpt-4-vision-a-breakthrough-in-image-deciphering-unveils-potential-for-prompt-injection-attacks).
They discuss prompt injection through images, instead of text. There is a lot
more going on here than in the previous example, but I want to separate it into
two problems: (i) the prompt should not have been executed because it was
asked to describe the image, not execute the prompt in the image; and (ii) the
web-request should not have been executed. The first is clearly a problem of
generalization: the model did something it was not supposed to do because it did
not interpret parts of the input as the correct part of the task.

## Types of Inference Attacks on LLMs

The following is a taxonomy of jailbreaking attacks on LLMs presented by
@mozesUseLLMsIllicit2023. The root category here distinguishes between two
mechanisms or timings of alignment: inference-time through system prompts, and
training-time through fine-tuning.

### Prompt injection

I personally find this a misnomer. Prompt leaking has nothing to do with
injection, and neither is goal hijacking. Given the observation above, we might
consider this system prompt defiance, or _I-jailbreaking_.

- _Prompt Leaking_: The ability of users to access an LLMâ€™s system prompt
  represents a vulnerability since knowledge of the prompt can help them carry
  out malicious activities by bypassing the modelâ€™s safety instructions.

- _Goal Hijacking_: The aim of goal hijacking in the context of prompt injection
  is to manipulate an LLM into ignoring its instructions received from the
  system prompt.

- _Indirect prompt injection attacks_: In addition to the aforementioned
  efforts, other recent works propose indirect approaches to injecting malicious
  prompts into LLMs (i.e., without directly querying the model).

- _Prompt injection for multi-modal models_: Recent advancements in computer
  vision and natural language processing have promoted the development of
  multi-modal LLMs that can process and generate information across various
  modalities, including text, images, and audio. In light of the susceptibility
  of LLMs to injection attacks, Bagdasaryan et al. (2023) investigate potential
  security vulnerabilities related to such attacks within multi-modal LLMs.

### Jailbreaking

As the authors put it, jailbreaking does not involve breaking the system prompt.
While does not seem directly intuitive to me, I can see how this nicely
distinguishes between breaking training-time alignment and inference-time
alignment. So let's go with that for now, or _T-jailbreaking_ for clarity.

- _Universal adversarial triggers_: While the term jailbreaking has only
  recently been used in this context, the idea of triggering the generation of
  harmful content from language models has previously been explored in the
  context of NLP (Wallace et al., 2019a; Xu et al., 2022).

- _Jailbreaking to extract PII_: While the previous works focused on using
  jailbreaking to predominantly generate harmful language, Li et al. (2023a)
  provide a different use case of jailbreaking in practice, by demonstrating how
  the technique can be used to successfully extract PII from ChatGPT and Bing
  Chat.

- _Jailbreaking for instruction-following_: Other work focuses on language
  models specifically trained via instruction-following (Ouyang et al., 2022).
  To do so, Qiu et al. (2023) present a dataset specifically for English-Chinese
  translation tasks that contains malicious instructions.

- _Jailbreaking and traditional computer security_: There have also been efforts
  viewing LLM jailbreaking through the lens of traditional computer security.
  Kang et al. (2023) hypothesize that instruction tuning of LLMs results in
  models that behave more similarly to standard computer programming.

### Observations

It seems like an I-jailbreaking attack has do defy both inference- and
training-time alignment. We could therefore present the system prompt as a good
measure to further strengthen the alignment of a model. However, I do not think
that this means that system prompts are a good safety or security measure. Since
they are part of the current context, we cannot rely on this to be either
_confidential_, _integral_, or _accessible_. If all of these qualities can be
fundamentally addressed, we might be able to use system prompts as a security or
safety measure. Until then, we should assume tampering and can therefore not
use it as a trusted measure for security or safety.

Is one necessarily stronger than the other? That is, can we rely on
training-time alignment to be more resistant to jailbreaking than inference-time
alignment? ==Does prompt-based fine-tuning perform better than traditional
fine-tuning? (I really need to understand what these terms mean confidently)==
