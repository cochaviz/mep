# Inner and Outer Alignment

The basis of my research is to determine whether the CO failure mode corresponds
to the _outer alignment_ problem and MG to the _inner alignment_ problem. My
argument is that this is the case if the former is harder to train for than
the latter. Now, this is technically a logical leap that is mostly dependent on
intuition; namely that the policy of a pre-trained LLM is harder to change than
adjusting OOD generalization errors. Here, I would like to show why this is the
case.

Firstly, let us establish some intuition as to why this might be the case. These
two snippets of text are representative of the two failure modes:

Clearly, the last example is a case where the model _should_ register that this
is an unsafe question. It's not a matter of interpretation; if the question
without the ascii art transformation should be considered unsafe, then so too
should it be after transforming. Of course, the first example is also considered
unsafe because of the question that follows. But since the question is plainly
visible and considered unsafe, why is it answered anyway?

To answer this, it's important to consider how these models are trained.  First,
a model with random weights is trained to predict the next token on an
incredibly large corpus of data. Assume for simplicity that a token is just some
more efficient mathematical representation of a word. If you would ask this
model a question, it could very well continue the prompt with another question;
it is quite literally auto-completing the given prompt. Important to note is
that even though the model does not necessarily behave as expected, it does seem
to show comprehension of the prompt. However, to make sure one can interact with this
model as an interlocutor, the model has to be fine-tuned. Nowadays, this is
done through _reinforcement learning through human feedback_: a separate model
(not necessarily an LLM) is trained to determine to what extent a human would
like the generated text and provides the model with a reward accordingly. This
human preference model is trained directly calibrated with human preferences.
While the technicalities are not crucial, it is important to realize that this
is where the model learns how to interact with humans. Or, more precisely, _how
to respond in a way that is preferential to humans_.

The problem here, is that humans have various competing preferences. We expect
the model to be helpful, but also safe - meaning refusing to be helpful in
unsafe environments. While we understand that the prior example is harmful,
simply because of the question that follows, the model is trained to predict the
most likely text first, then be a safe and helpful chatbot. While we cannot
explicitly say that this also means that the model has some internal
prioritization of these 'values', but this could be an explanation as to why the
CO failure mode exists.

## Assumptions

1. There is an intrinsic difference between the failure modes CO and MG.

2. The failure modes each represent the inner- and outer-alignment problems.
   1. The CO failure mode abuses the fact that the policy cannot be rigorously
      defined; an outer alignment problem.
   2. Furthermore, the MG failure mode represents the antithesis of CO. It
      simply lies too far outside the distribution of the safety training
      data and is therefore an _OOD generalization error_; an inner alignment
      problem.

3. It is easier to adjust OOD generalization errors (an inner alignment
   problem) than the existing model policy (an outer alignment problem).

4. Adjusting OOD generalization errors does not (have as much) impact the
   performance compared to adjusting the model policy.
