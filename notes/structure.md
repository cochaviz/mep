## The Case for the Evaluation of Machine Learning Security - How Models differ from Networks

Ask any person about whether they think the safety and security of AI is an
important matter, and I think they would be hard-pressed to say that it's of no
concern at all. Of course, this view might be skewed due to what some might call
a hype around AI and machine learning, but given the impact currently made by
AI, especially large language models, even critics of its future prospects have
to bend to its current wide-spread use. The reality is that AI in the form of
LLMs has gained such a tremendous popularity to those with an active internet
connection that, as with any digital system, we should be concerned with its
security. But how should we deal with the security of a system we barely
understand and can barely guide in the right direction?
