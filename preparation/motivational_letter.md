Dear Prof. Martin Vechev,

I am a graduate student at Delft University of Technology currently looking for
a Master's thesis subject to finish my studies. Your research group, _SRILAB_,
caught my attention in my search for a subject because of the pragmatic approach
and quality of the published research and, of course, the reputation of the ETH.
In short, I would like to apply for a Master's thesis at _SRILAB_, specifically
in the field of _Safe and Interpretable Artificial Intelligence_. Here, my hope
would be to focus on fairness guarantees (Fair Normalizing Flows by BalunoviÄ‡ et
al. (2022) comes to mind).

The field of AI Safety, in my opinion, can benefit greatly from varied
experience and a multidisciplinary approach. As mentioned before, I think the
field touches on many different areas normally not directly associated with
computer science. Over the past years, I have held various positions, from
student researcher to construction worker. These experiences are invaluable to
me when considering the impact of my work.

Accurately assessing the impact of one's work, however, is not sufficient. There
should also be adequate technical expertise and organizational skills to ensure
this impact can actually be achieved. I have experience both as a software
developer in various production environments

Lastsly, the ability
